### Sup homie! 🫡

I'm [**Tantour**](example.com), an Artificial Intelligence student based in Jordan.

If Mathemtics was a person, I would absolutely ask for their hand.

Statistics is REAL math, [send me location](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/045/458/send_me_locacccc.jpg) if you think otherwise. (don't please)

My main languages are Python, R, Java and C++. I use Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn and PyTorch.
